The user is asking, "What is a contract?" I need to answer based on the provided context.\n\nLooking at the retrieved context, under "Basic Contract Terms," it says a contract is a legal agreement between two or more parties enforceable by law. The essential elements include offer, acceptance, consideration, and mutual intent. \n\nSo the answer should start by defining a contract as a legal agreement between parties that\'s enforceable. Then mention the key elements. But the user\'s question is just the definition, so maybe stick to that first. However, including the elements might make the answer more complete. But the user might want a concise answer. Let me check the instructions: use three sentences max, keep it concise. \n\nThe first part from the context directly answers the question. The elements are part of another question. Maybe just use the first part. But the example answer given in the context for "What is a contract?" is exactly the first sentence. So the answer should be that a contract is a legal agreement between two or more parties enforceable by law. Maybe add the elements briefly. Wait, the user might not need the elements unless they ask. The question is just "What is a contract?" so the answer should be the definition. The elements are part of a different question. So the answer is the first part. But the assistant can mention the elements in a second sentence if needed. Let me check the example in the context. The answer for "What is a contract?" is the first sentence. The elements are under a different question. So maybe just the definition. But the user might benefit from a slightly more detailed answer. However, the instruction says to use three sentences max. So perhaps: A contract is a legal agreement between two or more parties that is enforceable by law. It requires essential elements like offer, acceptance, consideration, and mutual intent to be binding. This ensures all parties understand their obligations and rights under the agreement. But the elements are from another section. The user\'s question is just the definition. Maybe stick to the first part. Let me confirm. The exact answer from the context for "What is a contract?" is the first sentence. So the answer should be that. But to make it more helpful, maybe add the elements briefly. But the user didn\'t ask about elements. Hmm. The instruction says to use the retrieved context. The elements are part of another question but are relevant. So maybe include them as part of the answer. Let me structure it: A contract is a legal agreement between two or more parties that is enforceable by law. To be valid, it must include essential elements such as offer, acceptance, consideration, and mutual intent to be bound. This ensures that all parties are legally obligated to fulfill their agreed-upon terms. That\'s three sentences. The first sentence answers the question directly. The next two add the elements and their purpose. The user might appreciate that. But the original answer in the context for "What is a contract?" is just the first sentence. However, the assistant is allowed to use up to three sentences. So including the elements makes it more comprehensive. I think that\'s acceptable. Let me check the example again. The user might not need the elements, but since they are part of the context, it\'s okay to include them. So the answer would be the definition plus the elements. Yes, that\'s better.\n</think>\n\nA contract is a legal agreement between two or more parties that is enforceable by law.
